# MuseBandBiofeedback
An javascript app that monitors users’ brainwave signal quality by reading in EEG data from muse bands and provides in-time prediction of categories established based on different cognitive activities.

#Requirements

Please download the right version for your device from here and install:
http://developer.choosemuse.com/research-tools/museio

#How to use 

- Turn on your muse headband and pair up via bluetooth with your device
- On the command line(terminal/shell), enter "muse-io --osc osc.tcp://localhost:4444" to run MuseIO on port 4444
- On the command line, enter "muse-player -l 4444 -F Desktop/recording.muse -s 3333" to open up muse-player, let it save the data via the port being connected and sending data to port 3333 at the same time. (Note: this is the command line for saving a .muse file, for saving other files refer to http://developer.choosemuse.com/research-tools/museplayer/command-line-options for command line instructions.)
- On the command line, navigate to the location of osc-web by entering “cd osc-web” and then enter "node bridge.js" to run osc-web
- Open app.html
- Now you can submit different categories as you wish depending on the cognitive activities you are doing during any period of time, and also compare those to what the app would predict. For now, averages of your brainwave for each submitted categories can be viewed in the console only.
- If your muse band is experiencing bad connection with your skin, you will hear audio notification of which node is not connected correctly. (e.g. "Bad touch at left forehead.") Make sure the audio on your device is on. 
- Please note that these are in development and may change in future iterations. Suggestions and opinions are highly welcomed.
